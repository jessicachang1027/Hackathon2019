        <h2>Alcohol/Substance Abuse and Dependence</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and behavior 
            and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medication. Substances such as 
            alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs. When you're addicted, you may continue using the 
            drug despite the harm it causes.
        </p>
        <p>Drug addiction can start with experimental use of a recreational drug in social situations, and, for some 
            people, the drug use becomes more frequent. For others, particularly with opioids, drug addiction begins 
            with exposure to prescribed medications, or receiving medications from a friend or relative who has been 
            prescribed the medication.
        </p>
        <p>The risk of addiction and how fast you become addicted varies by drug. Some drugs, such as opioid painkillers, 
            have a higher risk and cause addiction more quickly than others.
        </p>
        <p>As time passes, you may need larger doses of the drug to get high. Soon you may need the drug just to feel good. 
            As your drug use increases, you may find that it's increasingly difficult to go without the drug. Attempts to 
            stop drug use may cause intense cravings and make you feel physically ill (withdrawal symptoms).
        </p>
        <p>You may need help from your doctor, family, friends, support groups or an organized treatment program to overcome 
            your drug addiction and stay drug-free.
        </p>
        <h4>Symptoms</h4>
        <p>Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly â€” daily or even several times a day</li>
            <li>Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts</li>
            <li>Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect</li>
            <li>Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended</li>
            <li>Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug</li>
            <li>Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it</li>
            <li>Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use</li>
            <li>Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm</li>
            <li>Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing</li>
            <li>Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug</li>
            <li>Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug</li>
            <li>Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug</li>
            <li>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Staging an intervention</h4>
        <p>People struggling with addiction usually deny that their drug use is problematic and are reluctant to seek treatment. 
            An intervention presents a loved one with a structured opportunity to make changes before things get even worse and 
            can motivate someone to seek or accept help.
        </p>
        <p>An intervention should be carefully planned and may be done by family and friends in consultation with a doctor or 
            professional such as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor, or directed by an intervention professional. It involves 
            family and friends and sometimes co-workers, clergy or others who care about the person struggling with addiction.
        </p>
        <p>During the intervention, these people gather together to have a direct, heart-to-heart conversation with the person 
            about the consequences of addiction and ask him or her to accept treatment.
