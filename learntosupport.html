        <h2>Learn How To Be a Supporter and Ally</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>How to Recognize Something is Wrong</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Withdrawing from social activities or appearing down for more than 2 weeks.</strong> 
                    This could mean crying regularly, feeling tired all the time or not wanting to hang out anymore. </li>
                <li><strong>Self-harming actions such as cutting or burning.</strong>
                    Some people may begin to wear long sleeves or pants to cover up signs that they are doing this.</li>
                <li><strong>Threatening to kill his- or herself or making plans to do so.</strong>
                    Although you may not know whether your friend is serious or not, it’s better to be safe and take things seriously.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme out-of-control, risk-taking behaviors.</strong> 
                    Behaviors that can endanger his- or her own life as well as others, such as speeding excessively and not obeying traffic laws, might be a sign that something is wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Sudden overwhelming fear for no reason</strong>
                    , including intense worries or fears that get in the way of daily activities like hanging out with friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Not eating, throwing up or using laxatives to lose weight.</strong>
                    Pay attention if your friend isn’t eating much at lunch or going to the bathroom right after meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe mood swings.</strong> 
                    Life is stressful, but if there seem to be outbursts that go beyond how other people would often act, it might mean something more serious.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeated use of drugs or alcohol.</strong> 
                    Coming to class hungover, showing up to sporting events intoxicated or wanting to bring drugs or alcohol into daily activities is not normal.</li>
                <li><strong>Drastic changes in behavior, personality or sleeping habits.</strong> 
                    Your friend might be sleeping much more or much less or get agitated more frequently.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme difficulty in concentrating or staying still.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <li><h4>How to Talk about Mental Health</h4></li>
            <p>Do you need help starting a conversation about mental health? Try leading with these questions and make sure to actively listen to your friend or family member's response.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I've been worried about you. Can we talk about what you are experiencing? If not, who are you comfortable talking to?</li>
                <li>What can I do to help you to talk about issues with your parents or someone else who is responsible and cares about you?</li>
                <li>What else can I help you with?</li>
                <li>I am someone who cares and wants to listen. What do you want me to know about how you are feeling?</li>
                <li>Who or what has helped you deal with similar issues in the past?</li>
                <li>Who or what has helped you deal with similar issues in the past?</li>
                <li>It seems like you are going through a difficult time. How can I help you to find help?</li>
                <li>How can I help you find more information about mental health problems?</li>
                <li>I'm concerned about your safety. Have you thought about harming yourself or others?</li>
            </ul>

            <li><h4>How to Offer Support</h4></li>
            <p>Keep in mind that your friend might not be ready to talk about what they’re going through or simply may not want your help right now. You cannot force someone to get help, 
            so just do your best to be there with your friend through their journey and be ready if and when they do finally reach out. It may be helpful to offer specific things that 
            might help, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can I best support you right now? Is there something I can do or can we involve others who can help?</li>
                <li>Can I help you find mental health services and supports? Can I help you make an appointment?</li>
                <li>Can I help you with the stuff you need to get done until you’re feeling better?</li>
                <li>Would you like me to go with you to a support group or a meeting? Do you need a ride to any of your appointments?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>You can play an important role in helping a friend build a positive, social support network. Here are ways to do that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check-in regularly.</strong> Call or text your friend once or twice a week. Check in with them after their therapy appointments to see how things went. Let them 
                know that you are there.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
