    <h2>Depression</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of 
        sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder 
        or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and 
        can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have 
        trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel 
        as if life isn't worth living.</p>
    <p>More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you 
        can't simply "snap out" of it. Depression may require long-term treatment.
         But don't get discouraged. Most people with depression feel better with 
         medication, psychotherapy or both.</p>
    <h4>Symptoms</h4>
    <p>Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically 
        have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the 
        day, nearly every day and may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness</li>
        <li>Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports</li>
        <li>Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort</li>
        <li>Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain</li>
        <li>Anxiety, agitation or restlessness</li>
        <li>Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements</li>
        <li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame</li>
        <li>Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things</li>
        <li>Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide</li>
        <li>Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Staging an Intervention </h4>
    <p>As soon as you suspect a mental illness or health problem in a loved one, seek 
        help from a professional interventionist right away. The longer you wait to 
        address a mental health problem, the more psychological damage it can cause. 
        An interventionist will help you know what to say to your loved one during an 
        intervention, treatments to recommend, and how to avoid becoming angry or overly 
        emotional during the process.</p>
    <p>If a mental health problem has already been affecting someone for a long period 
        of time, it’s likely too late for early intervention. At this point, your loved 
        one may have already lost the ability to care for his or herself, learn, work, 
        communicate, and have successful personal relationships. When a mental health 
        problem significantly interferes with a person’s daily life activities, known 
        as “serious functional impairment”, he or she needs treatment.</p>
