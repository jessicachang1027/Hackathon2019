<h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood 
    swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).
</p>
<p>When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. 
    When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of 
    energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior 
    and the ability to think clearly.
</p>
<p>Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some 
    emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.
</p>
<p>Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by 
    following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological 
    counseling (psychotherapy).
</p>
<h4>Symptoms</h4>
<p>There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. 
    Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty 
    in life.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired</li>
    <li>Increased activity, energy or agitation</li>
    <li>Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)</li>
    <li>Decreased need for sleep</li>
    <li>Unusual talkativeness</li>
    <li>Racing thoughts</li>
    <li>Distractibility</li>
    <li>Poor decision-making â€” for example, going on buying sprees, 
        taking sexual risks or making foolish investments</li>
</ul>
<h4>Staging an intervention </h4>
<h6>Therapy interventions for bipolar disorder include:</h6>
<h6><strong>Cognitive behavioural therapy or counselling</strong></Cognitive></h6>
<p>These approaches aim to alter negative thought and behaviour patterns that lead to difficulty in coping with the condition.</p>
<h6><strong>Family-focused counselling</strong></h6>
<p>This approach is aimed at family members and caregivers, providing them with support and guidance in coping with the impacts of 
    bipolar disorder on family relationships. The person suffering from bipolar disorder, their spouse and their family members need 
    to understand the importance of adhering to medications such as mood stabilizers and being able to identify symptoms of an oncoming 
    episode of severe depression or mania.
</p>
<h6><strong>Group therapy</strong></h6>
<p>Counselling individuals as part of a group can improve their ability to cope with the symptoms of their condition. Identifying with 
    other individuals suffering from similar disorders can ease the feelings of isolation or loneliness that living with mental illness 
    can cause. In addition, skills-based programs can help patients learn to cope with medication side-effects, problems in the workplace 
    and relationship issues.
